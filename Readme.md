I created this repository to showcase dashboards and analyses developed using Power BI, starting with panels created for various Kaggle Projects. 
# What is PowerBI
Power BI is a business analytics service offered by Microsoft, designed to offer interactive visualizations and business intelligence features through a user-friendly interface that empowers end users to craft their own reports and dashboards.
The decision to utilize Power BI was driven by several key factors:
- **Ease of data connectivity**
- **Powerful capabilities** reminiscent of Excel
- **Support for DAX and M programming languages**
- **Seamless integration** with R and Python
- **User-friendly interface**
- **Global popularity** and widespread adoption

Feel free to explore the files and delve into the dashboards I have created.
